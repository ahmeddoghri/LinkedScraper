# Icon Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the extension icons.

You'll need to create the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For a proper extension, you should replace these with actual icon image files.
You can create simple icons using an image editor or find free icon resources online.

The icon files should be stored in the 'images' directory as specified in the manifest.json file.
